## Hi I'm Massimo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computational biologist @ [Carmona lab](https://github.com/carmonalab) at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Department of Oncology of the University of Lausanne, and at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Currently my work is focused on the development of tools for single-cell biology and on their application to better understand immune responses in cancer and infection.

Here are some of the tools I developed (or contributed to):

#### Single-cell biology

* **GeneNMF:** unsupervised discovery of gene programs by non-negative matrix factorization. [GitHub](https://github.com/carmonalab/GeneNMF) - [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GeneNMF) - [Preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.31.596823)
* **UCell:** robust and scalable single-cell gene signature scoring. [GitHub](https://github.com/carmonalab/UCell) - [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/UCell) - [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.06.043)
* **scGate:** marker-based purification or classification of cell populations in single-cell data. [GitHub](https://github.com/carmonalab/scGate) - [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=scGate) - [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac141)
* **STACAS:** semi-supervised integration (batch-effect correction) of single-cell transcriptomics data. [GitHub](https://github.com/carmonalab/STACAS) - [Paper1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45240-z) - [Paper2](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa755)
* **ProjecTILs:** reference-based analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data. [GitHub](https://github.com/carmonalab/ProjecTILs) - [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23324-4)
* **SPICA:** web portal to explore our immune cell reference maps and to project into them your own data [Website](https://spica.unil.ch/) - [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1055)
* **SignatuR:** a database of useful gene signatures for single-cell analysis. [GitHub](https://github.com/carmonalab/SignatuR)
